                <h2>Consultation &amp; Design Discussion</h2>
                <p>Each commission begins with a personal conversation to understand your style, preferences, and the
                    occasions for which the garment will be worn. Together, we explore fabric choices, design details,
                    and the overall aesthetic to guide you to the first fitting.</p>

                <h2>Measurement &amp; Assessment</h2>
                <p>I take 17 measurements to use in the drafting process. Every aspect of your posture, stance, and
                    movement
                    is carefully observed and measured. These notes ensure that the finished garment complements your
                    natural form and comfort,
                    not just your dimensions.</p>

                <h2>Drafting &amp; Cutting</h2>
                <p> A paper pattern is then drawn entirely by hand. Drafted precisely to your body's dimensions. Once
                    finished, your pattern is laid out onto the fabric of your choice and cut with meticulous attention
                    to
                    grain, alignment, and balance.

                <h2>First Fitting (Baste Stage)</h2>
                <p>The initial fitting is hand stitched in-house ahead of your first fitting. This allows for the
                    fine-tuning of pattern alterations for balance, drape, and proportion before your garment is
                    finalized. After the first fitting, your garment will be ripped down to its two-dimenstional form
                    where I will incorporate any adjustment necessary to your pattern before moving ahead to your second
                    and final fitting.</p>

                <h2>Second Fitting</h2>
                <p>Once all the aspects of balance and fit are addressed in the baste fit stage, your garment will then
                    be sent out to my network of expert Savile Row trained makers for finishing. Each garment made from
                    years of experience and shared knowledge, passed down through hundreds of years of English tailoring
                    tradition.

                <p>Every detail is completed by hand - from buttonholes and pressing to final shaping. Once inspected
                    and perfected, the finished garment is presented, and your pattern is kept for future commissions.
